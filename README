DESCRIPTION

These tools aid in backporting patches from one git tree to another,
older tree (fork).  For example, they can be used to identify patches
that are present in the master branch of the kernel, but are missing
from a stable tree.  Typical use cases include backporting a feature
or backporting an entire subsystem.

The following tools are included:

find-missing-commits
find-fixes
order-commits

Let's say you want to backport driver fixes from upstream to a stable
kernel.  You can start by identifying the commits which are missing
from the stable kernel:

$ find-missing-commits -u /sbox/src/kernel/upstream/linux \
	-d /sbox/src/kernel/upstream/linux-stable \
	-b linux-4.18.y \
	-s v4.18 \
	drivers/scsi/mpt3sas

In this example, we specify the path to the upstream repository, the
downstream repository, the downstream branch to use (we're interested
in backporting to the 4.18.y stable branch), the start commit, and the
path(s) we're interested in.

The output will be a list of commit hashes that are missing from the
downstream branch.  If we redirect the output to a file, say
mpt3sas.cids, we can then use that file as input to the next two
commands.

$ find-fixes -r /sbox/src/kernel/upstream/linux -i mpt3sas.cids

This will output a list of commits that have a Fixes: tag pointing to
one (or more) of the commits in the mpt3sas.cids list.  If you combine
the two sets of commits, you can then order them so that they can be
applied:

$ find-fixes -r /sbox/src/kernel/upstream/linux -i mpt3sas.cids >> mpt3sas.cids
$ order-commits -i mpt3sas.cids -o mpt3sas.cids-ordered

And now you have an ordered (oldest to newest) list of commits to be
backported.  Of course, this isn't foolproof.  You may decide that
some of the commits aren't needed, or some commits may have
prerequisites elsewhere in the kernel.  That part is still left as an
exercise for the reader.

CONFIGURATION FILES

The tools all read "~/.backportrc".  It's an ini-style config file, and
currently only supports one section/entry:

---
[repo]
path = /sbox/src/kernel/upstream/linux
---

BUILDING

libgit2 is required.  For Red Hat distributions:

# yum install libgit2-devel

Then, simply type 'make'.
